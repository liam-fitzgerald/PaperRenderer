# Simple Frontend Boilerplate

A gulp/rollup/react boilerplate.

## Install

Pull down deps via npm:

```
$ npm install
```

## Build

Use gulp:

```
$ gulp bundle-component
```


## How This Works

To render a layout, you need:
1) A wallet generated by `keygen-js`.
2) An object containing written wallet copy and other metadata constants.
3) A JSON layout object exported from Figma and processed with the LayoutGenerator component.
4) A set of 'components' (not React) that describe how to apply the data to the layout. (In actuality, the layout data is inserted into the 'component')
5) A config object of what layouts and components to render.


`PaperCollateralRenderer` takes 5) A config object of what layouts and components to render, then:
1) loads any asynchronous items (images)
2) inserts data from a wallet and copy objects
3) inserts layout data from layout object into each property along an object path set in the layout object (content of a text field or name of a group in special component cases like QR, sigil, lists, pretty-print ethereum addrs)
3.1) part of this step is resolving special component layout objects. Items like lists need to have their y positions updated for example.
3.2) ???
4) profit.
