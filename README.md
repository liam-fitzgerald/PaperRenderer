# PaperRenderer

ðŸš§ Library under construction, use branch `rc-immediate` for working release. ðŸš§

[â†’ NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urbit-paper-collateral-renderer)

`PaperRenderer` generates PNG wallets that can be printed from [urbit-key-generation](https://github.com/urbit/urbit-key-generation). The layouts and static text content exist in Figma, and are imported via the `convert` script. This JSON is then saved to disk and bundled with `PaperRenderer` in release. The layout objects contain variable strings like `@heading` or `@management.seed.length`. `PaperRenderer` replaces these with real data. Variables can also specify special layout components like `#sigil@meta.patp`.

## Build

How to build/run for development:

0. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Paste in Tlon's Figma API token like the following:

`FIGMA_API_TOKEN="your-token-here-within-the-quotes"`

1. `npm run convert` translates the Figma design to JSON via the Figma API. You can target a specific Figma document by updating the document string and page name that are found in [convert.js](https://github.com/urbit/PaperRenderer/blob/c51c80e0e5895142b41ef06d2d48de1357f328f6/convert.js#L32), lines 32 and 34. You can retrieve a Figma document string id by opening the document in your browser and copying the string that appears before the document name. Each document has pages, which you can target with a name string, such as our current page [Registration 1.2](https://www.figma.com/file/a4u6jBsdTgiXcrDGW61q5ngY/Tlon-Paper-Wallet-v1.2?node-id=574%3A0).

2. `npm run start` builds all files for development and will watch for any JavaScript changes and serve the build on localhost:8000.

3. `npm run build` builds all files for production.

Making changes:

1. If you make changes to your targeted Figma document, you must re-convert the JSON with `npm run convert`.

2. Refreshing the webpage with `cmd+shift+r` will ensure that your browser doesn't render an older, cached version.
